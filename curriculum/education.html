                me to pursue a path in technology education, specializing in software development.Currently, I am enrolled as a student 
                at Brigham Young University (BYU), a distinguished institution renowned for its commitment to academic excellence and 
                values-based education. My experience as a BYU student has been transformative, providing me with an enriching environment

                to excel in my studies and future career. I recognize that the tech industry is fast-paced and constantly evolving, which is why 
                I am determined to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning 
                and professional growth, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and remain at the forefront of the industry.
