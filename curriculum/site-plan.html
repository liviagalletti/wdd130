      <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout my professional journey, I have had the opportunity to engage in various roles and experiences that have significantly shaped my growth 
        and development. One of the most impactful experiences was serving as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 
        São Paulo, Brazil.During my time as a missionary, I learned the value of selflessness and the importance of serving others. It was a humbling
        experience to be able to assist individuals and communities in need, providing support and spreading a message of love and hope. This experience 
        taught me the power of compassion and the impact that a helping hand can have on people's lives. 
        Furthermore, my professional journey led me to work as an attendant in a Samsung store. This role provided me with valuable 
        customer service skills, as I interacted with individuals from diverse backgrounds and assisted them in finding the right products for 
        their needs. It taught me the significance of listening to customers, understanding their preferences, and delivering a positive experience. 
        In addition to that, I had the opportunity to work as a sales representative in the pharmaceutical industry for Cimed. This role exposed me
        to the intricacies of the healthcare sector and taught me the importance of building strong relationships with healthcare professionals. I
        gained valuable insights into the pharmaceutical industry, product knowledge, and the significance of ethical practices in promoting healthcare 
        solutions.Through these experiences, I learned the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and continuous learning. 
        Each role provided unique challenges and opportunities for personal and professional growth. I developed effective communication skills,
         learned to navigate different work environments, and honed my ability to work collaboratively with diverse teams.
